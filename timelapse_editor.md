# How to effectively use Timelapse Editor?

1. Increase values of main countries for your timelapse. All of them should be visible on the first page (because you can export in .txt only info about first 15 countries. Also only first 15 countries are visible on the screen)

2. Use brush to change borders. Press on `+` icon to create new month/year and fill borders on all period you need

3. When you finished changing borders and you only need to change statistics data (numbers). Press on `Save statistics` button

5. You can change values yourself or copy this text and send it to Chatgpt/Claude Sonnet and ask it to fill correct historical numbers.
They can be not real, so be careful. Even if you have a list of some data for timelapse, it's easier to ask chatbot to correctly fill that file with your data. It's so boring to type everything yourself

6. Press `load statistics.txt` button in Timelapse Editor of Warnament
